üßç Musculoskeletal Disorders Risk Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts the risk of Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) in students using machine learning. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and classification of MSD risk levels (Low, Medium, High) based on physical and demographic factors.
